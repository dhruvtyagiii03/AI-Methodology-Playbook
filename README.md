# AI-Powered-Playbook
This fully functional, full-stack Playbook application was initially deployed on Google Cloud using credits provided by my college professor when I completed his course. Since the credits are time-bound, a complete demo video has also been prepared to showcase the app in action if the link doesn't work by then.

The application is built using Next.js for the frontend and Python-based backend utilising Flask and FastAPI. It integrates both PostgreSQL for relational database for context injection and Neo4j for handling graph database utilizing RAG.

To ensure smooth development and scalability, the entire application was containerized using Docker and deployed on a virtualÂ machine using Google cloud.
